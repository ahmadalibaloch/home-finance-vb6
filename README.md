# Home Finance (Visual Basic 6 Version)
A memorable first software developed by me &amp; [my brother](https://github.com/mansabbloch) in 2006 using VB 6 (Visual Basic 6) for home finance usage. I have included database with it in release folder for a history.

## Usage
For running on Windows10, you might need to register the ocx files provided in release folder. [Look here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59740756/regsvr32-error-the-module-was-loaded-but-the-entry-point-was-not-found) for how to register ocx files on Windows.
